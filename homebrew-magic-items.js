/**
 * Minor Golemheart
Wondrous Item (requires attunement by an Artificer)

This small, intricately carved clockwork heart is designed to be implanted into a homunculus servant, granting it additional power and resilience.

When you attune to this item, you can use your Artificerâ€™s tools to implant the Minor Golemheart into a homunculus servant, taking 1 hour to complete the procedure. Once implanted, the homunculus gains the following benefits:

Its hit point maximum increases by 10, and it gains resistance to one damage type of your choice (acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder).
Its Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Its attacks deal an additional 1d4 force damage.
Additionally, while the Minor Golemheart is implanted, you can communicate telepathically with the homunculus, even if it is more than 100 feet away from you.

Once implanted, the Minor Golemheart cannot be removed from the homunculus without causing it to be destroyed. If the homunculus is destroyed, you can retrieve the Minor Golemheart and implant it into another homunculus servant.
